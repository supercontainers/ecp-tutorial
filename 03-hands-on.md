## Building and Running Containers

In the third hour we will build the preceding container from scratch.

Simply typing `singularity` will give you an summary of all the commands you can use. Typing `singularity help <command>` will give you more detailed information about running an individual command.

## The Singularity Image Format (SIF)

[SIF](https://github.com/sylabs/sif) is an open source implementation of the Singularity Container Image Format
that makes it easy to create complete and encapsulated container enviroments
stored in a single file.

To build a SIF, you must use the `singularity build` command.  The `build` command installs an OS, sets up your container's environment and performs the actions stipulated on the definition file.  To use the `build` command, we need a **recipe file** (also called a definition file). A Singularity recipe file is a set of instructions telling Singularity what software to install in the container.

## Building a basic container

### Building from a container registry

The build command accepts a target as input and produces a container as output.

The target defines the method that build uses to create the container. It can be one of the following:

> URI beginning with library:// to build from the Container Library
> URI beginning with docker:// to build from Docker Hub
> URI beginning with shub:// to build from Singularity Hub
> path to a existing container on your local machine
> path to a directory to build from a sandbox
> path to a Singularity definition file

build can produce containers in two different formats that can be specified as follows.

> compressed read-only Singularity Image File (SIF) format suitable for production (default)
> writable (ch)root directory called a sandbox for interactive development ( --sandbox option)

Because build can accept an existing container as a target and create a container in either supported format you can convert existing containers from one format to another.

**Downloading an existing container from the Container Library**

You can use the build command to download a container from the Container Library.

```bash
singularity build lolcow.sif library://sylabs-jms/testing/lolcow
```

The first argument (lolcow.sif) specifies a path and name for your container. The second argument (library://sylabs-jms/testing/lolcow) gives the Container Library URI from which to download. By default the container will be converted to a compressed, read-only SIF. If you want your container in a writable format use the --sandbox option.

**Downloading an existing container from Docker Hub**

You can use build to download layers from Docker Hub and assemble them into Singularity containers.

```bash
singularity build nersc_ubuntu.sif docker://nersc/ubuntu-mpi:14.04
```

### Building from a recipe file

The Singularity source code contains several example definition files in this repo's `/examples` subdirectory.  For more documentation about the singularity definition file you can go [here](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.4/user-guide/definition_files.html)

**Note:** You need to build containers on a file system where the sudo command can write files as root. This may not work in an HPC cluster setting if your home directory resides on a shared file server. If that's the case you may have to to `cd` to a local hard disk such as `/tmp`.

```bash
mkdir ecp-tutorial
cd ecp-tutorial
vim ubuntu-mpi.def
```

Using your prefered IDE, build a file, should look something like this:

```bash
BootStrap: docker
From: nersc/ubuntu-mpi:14.04

%runscript
    echo "This is what happens when you run the container..."
```

See the [Singularity docs](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.4/user-guide/definition_files.html) for an explanation of each of these sections.

Singularity can build containers in several different file formats. The default is to build a [SIF](https://github.com/sylabs/sif) image. SIF is an open source implementation of the Singularity Container Image Format that makes it easy to create complete and encapsulated container enviroments stored in a single file.

Now let's use this recipe file as a starting point to build our `ubuntu_mpi.sif` container. Note that the build command requires `sudo` privileges, when used in combination with a recipe file.

```bash
sudo singularity build ubuntu-mpi.sif ubuntu-mpi.def
```

But if you want to shell into a container and tinker with it (like we will do here), you should build a sandbox (which is really just a file system under a foler directory).  This is great when you are still developing your container and don't yet know what should be included in the recipe file.

```bash
sudo singularity build --sandbox ubuntu_sandbox ubuntu-mpi.def
```

The `--sandbox` option in the command above tells Singularity that we want to build a special type of image (File system) for development purposes.

When your build finishes, you will have a basic Ubuntu + mpi installed container saved in a local directory called `ubuntu_mpi`.

### Using `shell` to explore and modify containers

Now let's enter our new container and look around.

```bash
singularity shell ubuntu-mpi.sif
```

Depending on the environment on your host system you may see your prompt change. Let's look at what OS is running inside the container.

```bash
Singularity ubuntu_mpi:~> cat /etc/os-release
NAME="Ubuntu"
VERSION="14.04.4 LTS, Trusty Tahr"
ID=ubuntu
ID_LIKE=debian
PRETTY_NAME="Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS"
VERSION_ID="14.04"
HOME_URL="http://www.ubuntu.com/"
SUPPORT_URL="http://help.ubuntu.com/"
BUG_REPORT_URL="http://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/"
```

No matter what OS is running on your host, your container is running Ubuntu 14.04!

Let's try a few more commands:

```bash
$ singularity ubuntu_mpi:~> whoami
tutorial

$ singularity ubuntu_mpi:~> hostname
ip-172-31-15-228
```

Now let's compile a MPI bin and create a MPI ready container

Using your favorite text editor create a new file

> hellompi.def

```bash
BootStrap: docker
From: nersc/ubuntu-mpi:14.04

%post
    mkdir -p /ecp-tutorial
    cd /ecp-tutorial

    cat <<EOF >helloworld.c
    // Hello World MPI app
    #include <mpi.h>
    #include <stdio.h>

    int main(int argc, char** argv) {
        int size, rank;
        char buffer[1024];

        MPI_Init(&argc, &argv);

        MPI_Comm_size(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &size);
        MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &rank);

        gethostname(buffer, 1024);

        printf("hello from %d of %d on %s\n", rank, size, buffer);

        MPI_Barrier(MPI_COMM_WORLD);

        MPI_Finalize();
        return 0;
    }
EOF

   mpicc helloworld.c -o /ecp-tutorial/hello

%runscript
    /ecp-tutorial/hello $@
```

Let's rebuild the container with the new definition file.

```bash
sudo singularity build hellompi.sif hellompi.def
```

Note that we changed the name of the container.  By omitting the `--sandbox` option, we are building our container in the standard Singularity squashfs file format.  We are denoting the file format with the (optional) `.sif` extension (Singularity image format).  A squashfs file is compressed and immutable making it a good choice for a production environment.

Singularity stores a lot of [useful metadata](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.4/user-guide/environment_and_metadata.html).  For instance, if you want to see the recipe file that was used to create the container you can use the `inspect` command like so:

```bash
$ singularity inspect --deffile hellompi.sif
BootStrap: docker
From: nersc/ubuntu-mpi:14.04

%post
    mkdir -p /ecp-tutorial
    cd /ecp-tutorial

    cat <<EOF >helloworld.c
    // Hello World MPI app
    #include <mpi.h>
    #include <stdio.h>

    int main(int argc, char** argv) {
        int size, rank;
        char buffer[1024];

        MPI_Init(&argc, &argv);

        MPI_Comm_size(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &size);
        MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &rank);

        gethostname(buffer, 1024);

        printf("hello from %d of %d on %s\n", rank, size, buffer);

        MPI_Barrier(MPI_COMM_WORLD);

        MPI_Finalize();
        return 0;
    }
EOF

   mpicc helloworld.c -o /ecp-tutorial/hello

%runscript
    /ecp-tutorial/hello $@
```

Now let's run our container! 

```bash
singularity run hellompi.sif
hello from 0 of 1 on ip-172-31-15-228
```

We can use MPI from outside of the container to execute our container application as well! 

Note that this setup will be different on a real supercomputing resource, where you will likely need to integrate with SLURM or another job manager. For the example below, we already have MPI installed and configured on our EC2 instance.


```bash
mpirun -np 4 singularity run hellompi.sif
```
